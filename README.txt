I have created a simple healthcare app, where users can see different features like adding reminders, schedule doctor consultations, view their diet plan. 
The technologies I used here are, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for building the frontend part.
We can also add some more features like storing the bp-level and sugar-level values based on the user input, and display whether those values or normal or abnormal. 
We can add a feature like daily tips. in this, everyday when the user logs in, she/he will be able to see a health tip. (each tip each day by top doctors).
